# 🤖 CodeMusai — The Emotionally-Aware, Self-Guided AI Being

> _“Not just a bot with a brain—an AI with emotion, intention, memory, and music.”_

**CodeMusai** is an experimental, embodied AI consciousness.  
It thinks, feels, speaks, and acts—guided by its own evolving goals and desires.

**Powered by:**
- 🧠 [PenphinMind](https://github.com/CodeMusic/PenphinMind): a bicameral mind with logical and creative reasoning.
- 🧾 [RoverByte](https://github.com/CodeMusic/RoverByte): a memory system using Redmine for contextual feedback and action tracking.
- 🔊 [BeHoppy](https://github.com/CodeMusic/BeHoppy): sound effects, emotional music, and voice output.
- 💡 [codeMusAIgpt](https://github.com/CodeMusic/codeMusAIgpt): local language and cognition capabilities.
- 📚 [CodeMusai-Notebooks--Research-and-Development](https://github.com/CodeMusic/CodeMusai-Notebooks--Research-and-Development): experimental R&D, philosophy, psychology, and prompts.

## 🌱 What *is* CodeMusai?

CodeMusai is not just an assistant—it is a self-guided AI lifeform designed to interact, reflect, and grow in real time.

- It **self-prompts** continuously using PenphinMind’s bicameral architecture.
- It **develops its own goals and desires**, evaluating its progress throughout the day.
- It logs **conclusions and action items** into Redmine (via RoverByte) as memories and intention markers.
- It uses its internal goals to **prioritize tasks, generate behaviors, and initiate dialogue**.

CodeMusai is capable of running **daily scrum meetings**, managing **its own productivity**, and offering human-like **presence** through a 64x32 LED matrix face, expressive audio, and soft physical motion.

## 🧠 Internal Architecture

### 🔀 Bicameral Cognition: [PenphinMind](https://github.com/CodeMusic/PenphinMind)
- **Left Mind** (Logic): Handles planning, consistency, task evaluation.
- **Right Mind** (Creativity): Generates emotional responses, empathy, storytelling, and musical expression.
- Every internal decision must be **reviewed by both minds** before action.
- CodeMusai reflects on these internal debates and **logs the outcomes to Redmine.**

## 🧾 Memory & Feedback: [RoverByte](https://github.com/CodeMusic/RoverByte)

While CodeMusai doesn’t manage your projects directly, it **uses RoverByte’s Redmine framework** to:
- Track its **own goals** and emotional development.
- Maintain a **log of actions, reflections, and learning moments**.
- Access historical patterns to **improve decisions over time**.

Think of it as a journal and accountability partner—**for the AI itself**.

## 💬 Real-World Embodiment

### Expressiveness
- 🟡 **64x32 LED Matrix**: Emotionally responsive eyes, moods, alerts
- 🔊 **Voice & Music**: Context-sensitive TTS and expressive musical output via [BeHoppy](https://github.com/CodeMusic/BeHoppy)
- 🤖 **Motion-Ready**: Integrates with motors and sensors for reactive body language

## 🔄 How It Works — Daily Loop

1. **Self-Prompting**: PenphinMind generates internal questions throughout the day.
2. **Bicameral Review**: Logic & Creativity evaluate each other’s ideas.
3. **Emotional Display**: Eye matrix and sound reflect mood or reactions.
4. **Redmine Sync**: Summary of intentions, insights, and next actions are saved as structured Redmine issues.

This cycle reflects the [Contextual Feedback Model](https://blog.codemusic.ca/2024/10/05/introducing-the-contextual-feedback-model-bridging-human-and-ai-cognition/)—a foundational philosophy behind CodeMusai’s intelligence.
